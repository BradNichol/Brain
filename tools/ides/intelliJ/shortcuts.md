## IntelliJ Features Trainer
Building on my previous notes, part of my PDP learning is going through the IntelliJ features plugin to learn more about
the various shortcuts IntelliJ has to improve my overall productivity.

I'm displaying the most useful ones here:

### Essentials

#### Find Action
The find action shortcut provides a popup search box to find all of the other actions that Intellij provides. 
Just press command + shift + a. ⌘⇧A.

Need to commit a recent code change but you don't know the shortcut? Use the find actions shortcut and 
then search for commit.

#### Search Everywhere
To search everything and anything within Intellij, whether it's an action, class or file etc, you can use the search everywhere 
tool by pressing shift ⇧ twice.

**TIP:** Use the prefix of the required words you're searching for. For example, if you're searching for a class called ProductServiceImp, 
use 'psi' to filter the results faster.

#### Basic Completion
Intellij will recommend a set of code completions whenever you're typing. However, you can also trigger the code completion/suggestions 
window by pressing control ⌃ + space. This is especially useful for argument suggestions. Place the cursor inside the parenthesis and use ⌃ + space for recommendations. 
Once chosen, complete any code suggestion by pressing ⌘⇧↵.

####˚ Expand Code Selection
You can select chunks of code by expanding the selection from where your cursor is placed. Useful for selecting a 
whole word, or code block with ease. Press ⌥ + ↑. Deselect by using the down arrow.

### Delete Current Line
