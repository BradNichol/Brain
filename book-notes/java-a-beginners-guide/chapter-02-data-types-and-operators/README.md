# Chapter 2. Introducing Data Types and Operators

## The Importance of Data Types in Java
Java is a strongly typed language, which under the hood means that all operations are type-checked by the
compiler for type compatibility. A string value cannot be stored in a variable of type Integer, this would be
considered an Illegal operation. Strong type checking helps prevent these sort of errors, especially in large
applications.

* Object-orientated
* Non object-orientated
