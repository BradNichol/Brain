# Chapter 1. Meet Apache Airflow

This chapter explores the concepts of data pipelines.

To handle the ever-increasing volumes of data, companies can use a variety of tools, including Airflow, a batch-orientated framework for building
data pipelines.

Airflow sits in the middle of data processors to coordinate work happening across different systems. Airflow does not process data itself, but
orchestrates the different tools involved in the processing.
