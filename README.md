# Knowledge Repository

This area of my website is designed to be my 'digital garden', a place where I can document what I'm learning,
without the necessity of writing a complete and polished blog. 

The idea is to document anything of value, small nuggets of information or full blown topics, with the intention to
let the topics or idea grow overtime.

And, just like a garden, it will never be finished, some areas will grow and other areas will die, so my main focus is 
for this to be a place to gather my knowledge without the pressures of overthinking how it should be presented.

With that in mind, this is my personal development space, designed to help me retain knowledge over time. 

For the time being, this aea will focus primarily on software development, but I may add all areas of interest
in the future. I'm still undecided on this.

Final note, as I'm using this as a learning tool, some of my notes may be incorrect at the time of writing, so
if you spot any issues, just let me know. Thanks.
