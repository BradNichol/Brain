# Entity Manager

The Entity Manager API is used to create, uodate, remove and find entity instances. 

Entities are managed by the Entity Manager and until an entity is managed it is considered to 
be a Plain Old Java Oject (POJO), in detached state.

Once it's managed, it is now in a managed state.
